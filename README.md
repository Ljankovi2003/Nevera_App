Nevera is an innovative mobile application designed to leverage the widespread availability of smartphones to enhance earthquake preparedness and response efforts. By harnessing the capabilities of the sensors embedded in modern smartphones, Nevera aims to create a vast network of mobile earthquake detectors that contribute to early warning and post-event analysis.
Core Features of Nevera:

## Earthquake Detection 
At the heart of Nevera's functionality is its ability to use the phone's sensors to detect unusual movements indicative of seismic activity. When the app detects what it considers suspicious vibrations, it automatically captures and sends this movement data to centralized servers for further analysis. This approach allows for real-time data collection from a vast array of locations, significantly improving the detection and analysis of potential earthquake events.

## Location Saving
In the event of unusual vibratory patterns suggestive of an earthquake, Nevera records the phone's last known location on the server. This critical feature ensures that, in the aftermath of an earthquake, responders have access to potentially life-saving information about the last known locations of individuals within the affected area. This data can be crucial for search and rescue operations, helping to prioritize efforts and resources more effectively.

Nevera offers a user-friendly interface with several key functionalities:

## Home Screen
The home screen serves as the central hub for the app, offering users immediate access to essential services. Here, users can quickly call emergency services, ensuring that help is just a few taps away in case of an earthquake or any other emergency. Additionally, the home screen provides real-time updates on recent earthquakes, keeping users informed about seismic activity in their area or globally.

## Earthquake Reporting Form

Recognizing the value of community reports, Nevera includes a feature that allows users to report observed earthquakes. This form enables users to contribute firsthand observations, enhancing the app's data pool and aiding in the accurate assessment of seismic events.

## Movement Monitoring Test

For users interested in understanding how the app detects seismic activity, Nevera offers a movement monitoring test. This feature allows users to see in real-time how their phone's movements are captured and analyzed, providing a transparent and educational insight into the app's detection capabilities.

## Conclusion

Nevera stands at the intersection of technology and disaster preparedness, embodying a forward-thinking approach to earthquake detection. By turning everyday smartphones into a collaborative network of seismic sensors, Nevera not only enhances early warning efforts but also plays a vital role in post-earthquake response and recovery. Its user-friendly design, coupled with its innovative use of mobile sensor technology, makes Nevera a pioneering tool in the quest to mitigate the impacts of earthquakes on communities worldwide.
